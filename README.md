# Flash Drought
Example python scripts to detect flash drought events from gridded soil moisture data

under /prep

- soilm_weighted.sh: to create soil moisture data at a specific depth (cdo)
- pentad.sh: to convert daily soil moisture data to pentad (cdo)
- compute_qval.py: to compute n-quantile of soil moisture over a given period (e.g. 20th/40th percentile to define FD onset/termination)
- prep_quan.py: to compute soil moisture quantiles at every time steps

under /main

- main_drought.py: to detect drought events at each pixel (e.g. soil moisture decreases from 40th to 20th percentiles)
- fd_detect.py: to select only FD (e.g. soil moisture 40th->20th percentile within n-days)
- extract_vars.py: to extract meteo/eco variables during FD events

These scripts are used in
